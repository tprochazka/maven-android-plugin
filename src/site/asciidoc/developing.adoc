= Developing

If you want to help on the actual codebase of the Android Maven Plugin, here is what you need

== Pre-requisites

* Android SDK installed
* Apache Maven installed - (3.2+1 or higher as enforced during the build
* Optionally for better testing,debugging support Eclipse with M2e and Maven Development Tools
* Optionally git or svn to get the code from github, unless you download the source as zip
* An Android device or emulator connected via ADB for full build

== Getting the code

You can just get the code from github as usual from the site https://github.com/simpligility/android-maven-plugin/

----
git clone git@github.com:simpligility/android-maven-plugin.git
----
 

== Building

The usual Maven invocations apply. A full build is done with

----
mvn clean install
----

To truly verify everything you also need to connect a device via ADB and run the integration tests

----
mvn clean install -P it
----


== Using 

Once you have build the plugin, you can use the respective version (x.y.z-SNASPHOT) in your own projects by updating the 
version in the pom files there.

If you invoke the plugin outside a Maven project specify the version like so e.g.

----
mvn com.simpligility.maven.plugins:android-maven-plugin:4.0.0-SNAPSHOT:undeploy -Dandroid.package=com.simplgility.android.helloflashlight
