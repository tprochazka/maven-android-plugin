= Releasing 

Manfred will document this all more but basically its the usual Maven setup. Some old stuff that has to be migrated is 
on the  https://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/wiki/Source[old site].

----
mvn release:prepare release:perform
----

With the right setup this will

* create a tag and push it to github
* prepare and deploy everything for the plugin release (jar, sources, javadoc..) to OSSRH
* release the staging repository on OSSRH so the plugin is automatically synced to the Central Repository
* deploy the site to github pages
